# 🧠 Analyzing Consumer Preference Trends with AI

This project explores how consumer interest has evolved in response to technological innovations using Google Trends data from 2004 to 2025. By applying AI models like clustering and classification, we identify behavioral patterns and segment shifts during the transition from Tech 2.0 to Tech 3.0.

## 📊 What’s Inside

- **Data Cleaning**: Parses and formats time series data for 5 key technologies.
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualizes consumer interest over time using Google Trends.
- **Clustering (K-Means)**: Segments months into distinct consumer behavior groups.
- **Classification (Random Forest)**: Identifies feature importance and predicts behavior patterns.
- **Tech Waves Analysis**: Separates analysis for Tech 2.0 (pre-2016) and Tech 3.0 (2016–2025).
